ðŸ’¬ **Adrian is in your church, so you like Adrian more than Maria**

We believe that our in-group or group of friends is superior to others, or that we are superior to others. We tend to pay more attention to and assist those who are members of our own group or a group to which we feel close. It could be because we have more empathy for them, they remind us of ourselves, or we feel validated.

We also have a tendency to value outsiders less than insiders.

**You can avoid it by doing the following**

- Praise your peersâ€™ work and accept criticism gracefully.
- Solicit feedback from outsiders and avoid making assumptions about them.
