## How to avoid the Fundamental Attribution Error bias

The fundamental attribution error is so prevalent because it’s rooted in psychology, so completely overcoming it can be difficult. 

One tool that can help you in combating FAE is **gratitude**. When you become resentful at someone for a bad “quality” they demonstrate, try to make a list of five positive qualities the person also exhibits. This will help balance out your perspective and can help you view them as a whole person instead of through the lens of a single negative quality.
