        ">
            <p>We rely heavily on the first piece of information introduced. It acts as an “anchor” that influences our subsequent judgments and decision-making.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Imagine you’re out shopping for a gift. You find a pair of sunglasses that you know they’d love. But they cost $100—way more than your $60 budget. Right beside it, you see this necklace for $80 -- still more than your budget -- but hey, it’s cheaper than the sunglasses. You buy the necklace instead, right?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This bias influences our thinking and behavior by making it difficult for us to consider other options or alternatives, and by limiting the range of information that we consider when making a decision.</p>
            <p>The reason why our brain uses this mental shortcut is to save time and cognitive effort. Rather than evaluating every piece of information we receive and considering all the possible options and alternatives, our brain uses the initial information as a starting point and focuses on the options and alternatives that are most relevant or related to the ‘anchor’. It helps us make decisions faster, but also leads to errors.</p>
            <p>Propaganda, for examples, is based on the anchoring effect at its root.</p>
            <h4>Product experiences</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A search engine that always shows the same results first anchors the user's decision and influence their choices. If the search engine consistently shows the most popular or relevant results first, leads users to believe that those are the best or only options, even if there are other relevant and useful results available.</li>
                <li>Smartphones come with a set of default settings that are automatically applied when the product is first used. These default settings anchor the user's decision-making and behavior, making it difficult for them to consider alternative settings or configurations.</li>
                <li>A fitness app that provides users with a default daily step goal anchors their behavior and influence their activity levels. If the default goal is too high or too low, leads users users to either over or underestimate their ability, and potentially lead to frustration or disappointment.</li>
                <li>An online shopping platform that always shows the same product first, or that always recommends the most expensive option first, anchors the user's decision and influences their choices. Leads users to believe that the recommended option is the best or only option, even if there are cheaper and equally good alternatives available.</li>
            </ul>
