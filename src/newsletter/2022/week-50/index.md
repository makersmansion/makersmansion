**Success is about HOW you work, not what you do**

Whenever I start a new initiative, I begin with setting expectations for myself before diving into it. That's why I take two days to do these three things:

1) **Dream**. I envision what my life will look like in six months—emotional
2) **Plan**. I map out the major milestones—logical
3) **Routine.** I develop a daily routine that will help me make progress—tactical

I’ve learned that if I’m not doing this exercise, I’m less likely to fully commit and the chances of actually getting things done decrease dramatically. Because achieving success it's more about your work ethic than the specific tasks you complete.
