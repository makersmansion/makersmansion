💬 "Choose your tomorrow but start today". As the noise will become prelevant in the next 24 months, we will have a harder and harder time to reach the signals - which can get us stuck. That's why I started this Makers Weekly newsletter, part of MakersMansion.xyz

Every Thursday you'll find here relevant resources and new #tools to help us build better teams and products. Consider subscribing if you're a designer, developer, product manager, marketeer, writer and startup founder.

Let's dive in, makers!

### #TOOLS
🎨 Github launches [Primer Prism](https://primer.style/prism/), a tool for creating and maintaining cohesive, consistent, and accessible color palettes. Not ready for prime time yet, while definitely the best tools I've tried for playing with scale.

🧑‍💻 Safari adds support for size queries in Container Queries, Container Query Units and Subgrid in the [latest release](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-16-release-notes) which means they're coming soon to the other browsers. Big win for frontend devs as we will do more with less code, big win for users as the performance will get a boost.

🥁 Do you struggle with feature adoption? Check out this [case study](https://growth.design/case-studies/google-feature-adoption) on how to increase feature adoption the right way with a Google Maps example

### #TEAM
🏠 New [Microsoft Study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01196-4) of 60,000 Employees finds that remote work threatens long-term innovation. In other words, short-term productivity goes up, long-term creativity goes down.

I find the overall internet debate on the subject to be way too polarised for my taste, with folks being either in the 100% remote camp or the opposite. Every company decides their work policies based on multiple factors, from size to culture to real estate investment to operational model and there's no general "right" way. 

One thing I'm concerned of tho is when small companies do whatever big companies decided to do, somehow similar to how blindly companies are implementing work processes just because *that's how Google/Spotify/etc is doing it* . Why not just do what's best for your team and be open to experiment? 🤷‍♂️ Anyways, 1 thing is clear: we brainstorm better face-to-face!

### #MARKET 
🎙 Insightful podcast from Christopher Lochhead on [how to make money in a recession](https://podcasts.apple.com/es/podcast/lochhead-on-marketing/id1475593214?i=1000565109949) and what's the difference between category vs brand. He then describes 5 steps to create demand for your product, service or platform.

📊 SaaS isn't dead, it hasn't even gone to bed! The SaaS market may look like it's in a bad shape but it's just a perception. [The data shared](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bradvanleeuwen_saas-saas-activity-6938187261746323456-ym0j/) by Brad van Leeuwen indicates the otherwise. If you're working in SaaS, keep executing!

🙃 Bonus for #FUN
Bloomberg [asked](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-10/goldman-citigroup-nasdaq-leaders-imagine-markets-in-2052) some top executives to tell us which innovations will make a difference in the next 30 years. OK!
