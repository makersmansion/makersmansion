 ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª Speaking of [rough times](https://google.com) in the Euro startupland, Atomico and Taavet+Sten just co-led a $26 million Series A funding round of a pre-revenue startup that calls itself the Stripe for NFTs.
 
 ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Klarna faces valuation slash to $15 billion as it seeks fresh round of funding. That's down from 45.6 billion from exactly a year ago - for context, in 2020 Klarna raised at $10.65 billion valuation, and then in 2021 at $31 billion. 
 
 Something seems off with this story - one hypothesis is that the financial losses may have commended much higher layoff numbers than the actual, and Siemiatkowski decided to go another route with a budget that works in a less aggressive growth scenario and hence a higher valuation haircut. 
 
 This can be a very tough spot - what do you choose between losing employees and shareholders value and how do balance it out? Fwiw Klarna cut off 10% of 7000 staff while its net loss in the first quarter of this year was 4X higher than a year earlier at $250 million as credit losses rose by 50%. It may also be that in 6-9 months Klarna does another round of layoffs, if things worsen and the above 'beginning of the dip' goes downward within a longer timeframe. 
 
 Not least interesting, coincidence or not, Apple's BNPL announcement couldn't have come at a worse moment for Klarna.
 
 ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Qualcomm wins fight against $1 billion EU antitrust fine imposed four years ago.

ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª The Swedish city of MalmÃ¶ installed public trash cans with audio that conveys sexy comments of encouragement to folks who deposit their litter. The audio uses a female voice saying messages like "Oh, right there, yes!", "Come back soon and do that again!" and "Mmm, a bit more to the left next time".
