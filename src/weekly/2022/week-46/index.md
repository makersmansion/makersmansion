💬 **How do you stay very grounded, and at the same time reach for the stars?**

Everything that’s real and it’s profound has to have both, because it’s a vibratory thing. It’s the force that makes things happen. 

What you have to say is, “I’m gonna do the best I can now. I’ll go to the next thing and do the best I can there.” And it sounds trite and superficial, but it’s not.

> Our mission in life is to make a positive difference, not to prove we’re smart and not to prove we’re right. We are not here on earth to prove how smart we are.

> If you don’t change your beliefs about yourself it can be hard to change your behavior.

> Never make your value as a human being conditioned on the results of what you’re trying to achieve. 

> One of the key points is live your own life. And by the way, when you live in the past, you’re living someone else’s life.
