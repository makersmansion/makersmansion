title: "AI eating the world, the advertising bubble, and IQ tests"

**It’s not a tech bubble, it’s an advertising bubble**

Google, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc don’t have a product, they have an audience. And their business is selling ads. Is online advertising working? Probably not.

To illustrate, consider Steve Tadelis’s eBay research. Ebay lost $0.63 cents on every dollar they put into Google search advertising, but that’s actually an imprecise estimate. If the experiment were to be replicated infinitely (and another ad stop, and another ad stop, and another ad stop...), in 95% of all ad stops the true loss would fall in the range of negative $1.24 and negative $0.03. This is what statisticians call the confidence interval. In advertising research, the confidence interval tends to be huge.

**But..**

> Marketeers actually believe that their marketing works, even if it doesn’t.

🧐 [Is IQ a load of BS?](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/iq-load-bs/) IQ tests are not useless, but they are limited. The main problem is that IQ is widely misunderstood. It is simply a measure of how a person performs on a narrow set of questions compared to other people.

## MARKET

🦾 [Amazon's new robotic arm Sparrow](https://fortune.com/2022/11/10/amazon-new-robot-sparrow-replace-human-workers/) is capable of handling millions of different products. It is able to grab items of different sizes and textures and place them in boxes. The robot could replace humans at Amazon's warehouses, but this may require the warehouses to be redesigned.

👻 [The reason for Meta's massive layoffs](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-layoffs-overhiring/)? Ghosts in the Machine—new projects helped Facebook to accumulate employees rapidly. The company has continued to keep staff on even after projects have been deemed unsuccessful and shut down. Meta would hire new employees with each new project, and when those projects were over, the employees would just work on experiments and research.

📈 [YouTube Music and Premium added 30M](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23449067/youtube-music-premium-subscriber-growth-2022) subscribers in one year, bringing the total to 80M across both platforms. These new numbers indicate that YouTube Music and Premium are growing even faster this year than the last. In last year’s report, YouTube said it added 20M subscribers across both its services in just one year.
