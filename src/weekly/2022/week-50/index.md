**Success is about HOW you work, not what you do**

Whenever I start a new initiative, I begin with setting expectations for myself before diving into it. That's why I take no more than two days to do these three things:

1) **Dream**. I envision what my life will look like in six months—emotional
2) **Plan**. I map out the major milestones—logical
3) **Routine.** I develop a daily routine that will help me make progress—tactical

I’ve learned that if I’m not doing this exercise, I’m less likely to fully commit and the chances of actually getting things done decrease dramatically. Because achieving success it's more about your work ethic than the specific tasks you complete.

## TEAM

🙈 [A humorous yet accurate thread](https://twitter.com/peteryared/status/1596641022796173314) about the differences in product development before and after 2010:

**Before 2010**

1. PM adds ticket to Kanban board “Add a date picker to the date fields”
2. UI Engineer picks ticket, finds 3 suitable components, emails PM which do you like 
3. Date picker implemented
4. QA team make “pick a date” test plan & QAs
5. Ships in next release

**After 2010**

1. New ticket in Jira “Add a date picker to the date fields” 
2. Ticket triage with product managers and architects, architects select date component to use 
3. UX team designs all possible interactions in Figma 
4. Scrum meeting where tickets are selected
5. Product manager writes detailed ticket with definition of done 
6. Estimation where team estimates time to implement date picker 
7. Junior UI Engineer assigned ticket
8. Bugs in the date picker component -> emergency Slack -> ticket kicked out of sprint -> back to Step 2. 
9. Date picker component can’t implement all the UX interactions in Figma -> emergency Slack -> ticket kicked out of sprint -> back to Step 2
10. Sprint reconciliation where all of the above is discussed in excruciating detail and passive aggressive tensions allegedly resolved between product managers, architects, UX, engineer, with conclusion to have more meetings at each above step so this doesn't happen again
11. Ticket delayed due to new priorities 
12. Junior UI engineer complains to HR about terrible onboarding and mentoring processes 
13. External scrum coach brought in to improve process and communication 
14. Management: “How can it take so fucking long to add a date picker?!?!?”
