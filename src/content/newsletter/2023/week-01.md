**Happy new year everyone** 🎉

2023 is the first _real_ new normal after the pandemic. It’s clearly not a walk in the park giving the current economical challenges, but let’s keep the focus. I believe it will be the best year for makers, it will be about doing more with less, results over process, and personal growth for a generation that meets a recession for the first time.

Let’s dive in!
